# Application Server
An application server and a Web server are both software application that facilitate networked communication, but they serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities:

## Web Server:
+ Primary function: Serving static web content (HTML, CSS, images, videos) over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
- Handles client requests and returns responses.
* Typically used for hosting websites, serving web pages, and delivering static content.
+ Examples: Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS, Nginx.

## Application Server
- Primary function: Managing and executing business logic, applications, and dynamic content.
+ Hosts and executes application code, such as Java, Python, or Ruby.
- Provides additional features like load balancing, security, and transaction management.
+ Examples: Apache Tomcat, IBM WebSphere Microsoft (link unavailable), Oracle WebLogic.

## Key differences:
* Web Servers focus on serving static content, while Application Servers manange dynamic content and business logic.
* Web Servers are typically stateless, while Application Servers maintain session state and manage application content.
+ Web Servers are generally faster and more scalable for serving static content, while Application Servers provide additional features and functionality for dynamic application.
