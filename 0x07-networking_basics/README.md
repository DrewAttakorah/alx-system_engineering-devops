# Networking basic #0
Networking basics encompass fundamental concepts and principles of computer networking.

## OSI model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how different networking protocols and technologies interact to facilitate communication between devices on a network. It divides the process of network communication into seven abstraction layers, each responsible for specific functions.

- ### Physical Layer (Layer 1):

This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over the network medium, such as cables, wires, or wireless signals.
It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of communication, including voltage levels, cable types, and signaling.

- ### Data Link Layer (Layer 2):

The data link layer is responsible for the reliable transfer of data between adjacent nodes on the network.
It handles tasks such as framing, error detection and correction, flow control, and access control (e.g., MAC addresses in Ethernet).

* ### Network Layer (Layer 3):

The network layer focuses on routing and forwarding data packets between different networks.
It provides logical addressing, such as IP addresses, and determines the best path for data to travel across interconnected networks.

+ ### Transport Layer (Layer 4):

The transport layer ensures end-to-end communication between hosts and provides reliable data delivery.
It handles segmentation and reassembly of data, error recovery, flow control, and end-to-end connection management (e.g., TCP).

- ### Session Layer (Layer 5):

The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.
It handles session synchronization, checkpointing, and recovery mechanisms.

- ### Presentation Layer (Layer 6):

The presentation layer deals with the syntax and semantics of the data exchanged between applications.
It is responsible for data translation, encryption, compression, and formatting.

+ ### Application Layer (Layer 7):

The application layer provides network services directly to end-users and applications.
It includes protocols for specific applications such as HTTP for web browsing, FTP for file transfer, SMTP for email, and DNS for domain name resolution.

# What is a LAN
A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that covers a relatively small geographic area, such as a single building, office, campus, or home. It connects multiple devices within this limited area to enable communication, resource sharing, and collaboration.

### Typical Usage
+ LANs are commonly used in office environments to connect computers, printers, servers, and other devices, allowing employees to share files, access shared resources, and communicate with each other.
+ In educational institutions, LANs are used to connect computers in classrooms, laboratories, and libraries, facilitating access to educational resources and collaborative learning.
* LANs are also used in homes to connect various devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and gaming consoles, enabling internet access, file sharing, and media streaming.

### Typical Geographical Size:
- LANs typically cover a small area, ranging from a single room or floor within a building to multiple buildings within a campus.
* The size of a LAN is limited by the physical constraints of the network medium, such as the maximum length of Ethernet cables or the range of wireless access points.
+ In general, the maximum distance covered by a LAN is a few hundred meters to a few kilometers, although technologies like Ethernet and Wi-Fi can be extended using repeaters, switches, and access points to cover larger areas.

## What is a WAN
- Typical usage
+ Typical geographical size
## What is the Internet
+ What is an IP address
- What are the 2 types of IP address
- What is `localhost`
* What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created
## TCP/UDP
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
- What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
+ Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
- What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
