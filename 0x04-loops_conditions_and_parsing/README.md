# Loops, conditions and parsing

## Bash Scripting Concepts

### Loops
Loops in Bash allow you to iterate over a set of commands multiple times, enabling automation and repetition in your scripts. Common loop constructs include the `for`, `while` and `until` loops.

### Conditions
Conditional statements in Bash enable you to control the flow of execution based on specified conditions. This allows for decision-making within your scripts. Common conditional constructs include the `if`, `elif` and `else` statements.

### Parsing
Parsing in Bash involves extracting and manipulating data, ofthen from strings or command outputs. This is achieved through techniques such as variable expansion, command substitution, and string manipulation.
